# Ymir Engine

### Repository Link: [Ymir Engine](https://github.com/francesctr4/Ymir-Engine)

### Current release version: None

### GitHub page: (In Progress)

## Description

Ymir Engine is part of the Game Engines subject, on the third year of the Videogame Design and Development degree, 
taught at CITM UPC (Terrassa) and supervised by [Miquel Suau](https://github.com/MayKoder).

The engine has been made from scratch in C++ using SDL and OpenGL to manage graphics. The main target of the project is to
be able to integrate complex systems such as graphics management and game engine architecture in a simple and understandable way
for educational purposes.

## Instructions

- How to use the engine, detailing the controls and any specific action
- Camera
- Editor Windows
- ...etc
- The shader is currently responsible for the transformations on the gameobjects, so if you upload a model without a texture,
the shader won't be enabled and the transformations won't be applied.

## Features

### v0.1 - Geometry Viewer

- Baker House automatically loaded at the start.
- Two models provided in FBX format with one channel diffuse texture.
- Drag&Drop of FBX files from anywhere in the Hard Drive.
- Drag&Drop of DDS/PNG files (apply the texture to the selected GameObject).
- GameObject structure, one for each loaded mesh.
- Three components available for the GameObjects: Transform, Mesh and Material.
- Unity-like camera controls.
- Editor Windows:
  - Console: Show LOGs.
  - Configuration:
    - A graph for the frames per second.
    - Configuration for variables on each module (renderer, window, input, textures).
    - Information output of memory consumption and hardware detection.
    - OpenGL configuration.
    - ...and more!
  - Hierarchy: list with all GameObjects with tree structure. The user is able to select a GameObject through this window.
  - Inspector: displays information about the components of the selected GameObject.
- About Modal Window to get info about the engine.
- Menu to load basic shapes.

## Additional functionality (Cool features!)

- Early Shader Implementation for Rendering Geometry with VAO (Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader).
- Apply Transformations to Geometry with the Transform Component (Translation, Rotation and Scale).
- Custom Icon Uploaded to the Engine Executable.
- Extensive primitive library inside the engine on GameObject menu.
